# UX Projects
A brief portfolio of UX projects I worked on and I'm allowed to show.

### Rossmann app
That was a project made in cooperation with 3 other students during Usability course as part of my Cognitive Science degree.

Main goal of this project was to design a feature\redesign the app in a way fitting to a target group defined by us. In the case of my group, we decided to target the product to middle aged mothers who go shopping after work and want to have it done both quickly and possibly cheap. We conducted interviews with women fitting our target group to gather information on the priority of changes we should make. Next, we prepared the list of changes and addition we should introduce to the app, to meet target group's expectations. We decided to rearrange many parts of the app, so it was easier to find all neccecary information and also to add a *shared lists* feature, which allow several users to create and edit a shared product list. In the end, we conducted usability tests, in which users got to perform the same tasks in both official and our version of the application. Usability tests showed, that redesigned version was cleanier, easier to navigate and more user-friendly.

Project was finished in June 2024, so current version of the Rossmann app may vary from the one we chose to redesign.

### HEALTHMAXXING - medication reminder and health documentation app
That was a project made as a part of the IV Cognitive Hackaton, taking place in May 2024.

HEALTHMAXXING is an app targeted primarly to people taking medication permanently or for a prolonged period of time and those, who need to be in contact with their doctor. Our gimmick for this app to increase it's effectiveness was gamification through a virtual pet, which could be interacted with. A user could gather in-app currency to purchase cosmetics for the pet by fulfilling all goals for a given day. To reduce the risk of misusage of medication, we decided to give the user **fixed** amount of the currency for each day, regardless of how many goals were there to fulfill. As the goals we mean daily medication prescribed by the doctor, supliments added by the user themself and various non-medical guidelines given by the doctor (such as well-being instructions, i. e. drinking some amount of water for the day). Also, HEALTHAXXING is supposed to help the doctor to track patient's recovery and status as well as to allow quick remote communication. Our app was supposed to keep patient's medical documentation and allow integration with outer systems such as polish E-receipt system, or devices such as smartwatches, to help track patient's status. As our app deals with sensitive data, the development plan assumes sale of the app to a bussines able to handle those.

Everything in this project took about 18 hours to accomplish, including the idea, design, safety measures, development plan and "client" consultations. This project is not finished, but I intend to leave it as it is.
